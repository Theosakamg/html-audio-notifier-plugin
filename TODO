    - HtmlAudioNotifier
        - is the Plugin-class required?
        
    - remember to synchronize usage of the event-repo, or build a little tx-template to do it..
        
    - BuildResultsInterceptor
        - start intercepting some results =)
        - unit-testing
        - some shared datastructures between the plugin/json stuff & the interceptor
	
	- config
	   - test sounds, callbacks for 'playing' & 'onerror'
	   - sjekk canPlayType crapen og vis i GUI, html-audio capable browser.., muligens p√• footer as well?
        /*if (audioElement.canPlayType) {
            alert('canPlay');
        }
        
    - expire the prevSoundId muuch sooner, also.. soundId? eventId?
        - if the specified eventId doesn't exist, make the client clear it's cookie.. set to null / remove?
