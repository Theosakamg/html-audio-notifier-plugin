	- What's the point of the Plugin-class? is it required for the js-callbacks?
		- could maybe the RunListener be the 'main' class?
	
	- plugin's global.jelly enable/disable sounds by default .. checkbox
	
	- client.jelly can probably be converted to plain javascript in src/main/webapp
		- create a more generic audio-player? that can be used from the config-pages to test sounds as well?
	 
	- GlobalBuildListener in a top-level class?
	
	- basic config, sounds for failed, failed-again, success-after-failure?
	
	- html page for sounds, or maybe embed in the main-page w/ off/on controls? maybe http://xxxxx?simpleSoundNotifier=on

	- pom-TODO's	
	- README
	- config/help etc
	
	- license-information in the descriptor-files?
		- tango icons
		- wav files...
